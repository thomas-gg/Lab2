                    <h3>An OK Day!</h2>
                    <p>Today I have a 15L lab which is somewhat fun. It is wayyyyyyyyy less interesting over zoom as a tutor though. Especiall the beginning with 0 tickets. Even though your fellow tutors are right there, nobody talks and everyone presumably is doing something else :( BUT I had a lot less to do today as compared to TU/THU</p>
                    <p>Also I heard one of my favorite songs though! This song on guitar is by Keshi (also this is my second take, so cut me some slack LOL)</p>

                        <p>To be completely honest I really like the music 1 series! It is unfortunate I didn't get to learn/play piano (because of online learning), but at least I'm learning guitar.</p>

                    <h3>Another Pretty Good Day!</h2>
                    <p>Yesterday was pretty <b>tiring!</b> In order I:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Skiped Music lecture so that I could watch Dasgupta's 101 lecture</li>
                        <li>Went to on campus UCSD to study with 2 friends</li>
                        <li>Exercised with them by playing frisbee</li>
                        <li>Watched the lecture for the class that I am tutoring for (CSE 12)</li>
                        <li>Went to a shoe store (skipping 101 since I watched the morning lecture)</li>
                        <li>Watched part of 110 while in the shoe store <i>very unfortunate timing LOL</i> :*( </li>
                        <li>Got back to my apartment and continued watching lecture with a cat on my lap</li>
                        <li>Took pictures with my <a href="https://tse.ucsd.edu"> Triton Software Engineering</a> group</li>

                    <h3>A <span>Pretty</span> Good Day!</h2>
                    <p>I really didn't think it could be that cool! It was a Monday and I had tutored for the second time ever! It was so much <i>easier</i> than the first time. The first time, the homework was due the same day and there was a constan <em>20+ tickets!!!</em> <br> This time though <strong>I got to relax and have fun</strong> with the tickets I did get. Other than that I just had some other training, so overall I was happy with what I did.</p>
                    <p>Also I saw this cutie (my apartment mate's cat)</p>
