                    <h3>Another Pretty Good Day!</h2>
                    <p>Yesterday was pretty <b>tiring!</b> In order I:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Skiped Music lecture so that I could watch Dasgupta's 101 lecture</li>
                        <li>Went to on campus UCSD to study with 2 friends</li>
                        <li>Exercised with them by playing frisbee</li>
                        <li>Watched the lecture for the class that I am tutoring for (CSE 12)</li>
                        <li>Went to a shoe store (skipping 101 since I watched the morning lecture)</li>
                        <li>Watched part of 110 while in the shoe store <i>very unfortunate timing LOL</i> :*( </li>
                        <li>Got back to my apartment and continued watching lecture with a cat on my lap</li>
                        <li>Took pictures with my <a href="https://tse.ucsd.edu"> Triton Software Engineering</a> group</li>
                        <li>Participated in the tutor staff meeting</li>
                        <li>Graded for the rest of the day!</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>A <span>Pretty</span> Good Day!</h2>
                    <p>I really didn't think it could be that cool! It was a Monday and I had tutored for the second time ever! It was so much <i>easier</i> than the first time. The first time, the homework was due the same day and there was a constan <em>20+ tickets!!!</em> <br> This time though <strong>I got to relax and have fun</strong> with the tickets I did get. Other than that I just had some other training, so overall I was happy with what I did.</p>
